# Solving-Combinatorial-Optimisation-Problems-Using-Quantum-Algorithms-Bugfixed
Part of work done under FZJ in 2022, a fork of https://github.com/QuCO-CSAM/Solving-Combinatorial-Optimisation-Problems-Using-Quantum-Algorithms/blob/main/QuadraticAssignmentProblem/Code/QAOA.ipynb

Mainly to solve the quadratic assignment problem with QAOA. The solver is good, but the amount of qubits and data required is not there yet for NISQ devices (max in simulation around 5x5).
